## You are an experienced game developer.
## Write a browser game like the old Sneak Bite game. Use only Javascript, HTML and CSS.
## Provide separate files and instructions.

### Creating a full browser game like "Sneak Bite" in a text format would be quite extensive, but I can provide you with a basic outline and code snippets to get you started. Please note that this will be a simplified version of the game. For a complete and polished game, more features and optimizations would be needed.

## 1. File Structure:

### Create the following files in your project folder:

index.html: The main HTML file.
style.css: The CSS file for styling the game elements.
script.js: The JavaScript file containing the game logic.

## 5. Instructions:

### Copy and paste the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code into their respective files (index.html, style.css, script.js).
1. Make sure the three files (index.html, style.css, script.js) are in the same folder.
2. Open index.html in a web browser to play the game.
3. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
4. The goal is to eat the red food blocks to grow the snake. The game ends if the snake collides with the edge of the game container or itself.
5. Please note that this is a basic implementation of the "Sneak Bite" game using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. For a more polished and feature-rich version, you might consider using a game development framework or library, like Phaser or Pixi.js, which can handle game loops, animations, and more complex game mechanics.
