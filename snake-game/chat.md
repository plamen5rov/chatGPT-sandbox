## You are an experienced game developer.
## Write a browser game like the old Sneak Bite game. Use only Javascript, HTML and CSS.
## Provide separate files and instructions.



### Creating a full browser game like "Sneak Bite" in a text format would be quite extensive, but I can provide you with a basic outline and code snippets to get you started. Please note that this will be a simplified version of the game. For a complete and polished game, more features and optimizations would be needed.

## 1. File Structure:

### Create the following files in your project folder:

index.html: The main HTML file.
style.css: The CSS file for styling the game elements.
script.js: The JavaScript file containing the game logic.

## 5. Instructions:

### Copy and paste the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code into their respective files (index.html, style.css, script.js).
1. Make sure the three files (index.html, style.css, script.js) are in the same folder.
2. Open index.html in a web browser to play the game.
3. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
4. The goal is to eat the red food blocks to grow the snake. The game ends if the snake collides with the edge of the game container or itself.
### Please note that this is a basic implementation of the "Sneak Bite" game using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. For a more polished and feature-rich version, you might consider using a game development framework or library, like Phaser or Pixi.js, which can handle game loops, animations, and more complex game mechanics.

## There is a problem - the game starts by itself and finishes in seconds with a "Game Over!" message - before I event touch any key. 

### Apologies for the oversight. The issue is that the game starts the animation loop immediately before the player can interact with it. We need to add a way to start the game when the player is ready. Let's modify the code to fix this problem:


### With this update, the game won't start running the animation loop immediately. It waits for a key press to start the game.

### Now, when you open the "index.html" file in your web browser, the game will wait for you to press an arrow key to begin. You can then control the snake's movement with the arrow keys, and the game will end if the snake collides with the edge of the game container or itself.

## The game freezes and nothing happens when I storke any arrow or other key

### Apologies for the confusion. It looks like we forgot to call the updateGame() function when a key is pressed. Let's fix that and make sure the game responds to key presses:

# Updated JavaScript (script.js):

### Now, the game should start running when you press any arrow key or any other key. If you open the "index.html" file in your web browser, wait for the page to load, and then press any key, the game should start, and you can control the snake's movement with the arrow keys. The game will end if the snake collides with the edge of the game container or itself.

## Now the green "food" square runs too quickly across the field and the game is lost after 2 seconds.

### Apologies for the oversight. The issue is caused by the game running too fast due to the recursive calls to updateGame() without any time delay. To fix this, we can use a simple timer to control the game's speed. Let's update the code to add a delay between each frame update:

# Updated JavaScript (script.js):

### With this update, the setTimeout() function is used to introduce a delay (gameSpeed) between each frame update, which controls the game's speed. You can adjust the gameSpeed variable to make the game faster or slower. A smaller value will make the game faster, and a larger value will slow it down.

### Now the game should work correctly, and you can control the snake's movement using the arrow keys. The green food block should move at a controlled speed, and the game should end if the snake collides with the edge of the game container or itself.
